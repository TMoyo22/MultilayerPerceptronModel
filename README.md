# MultilayerPerceptronModel
Predictive Modelling For Site Precision And Elevation.
Predictive Modelling For Site Precision And Elevation. Using an Edge Computing Server location dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmaneunus/edge-computing-edge-servers) I used a MUltilayer Perceptron model to predict **'SITE_PRECISION'** and '**ELEVATION'** from 'LATITUDE', 'LONGITUDE', 'LICENSING_AREA_ID', 'POSTCODE' information.

Libraries Used:
import pandas as pd:
- Used for working with datasets in terms of cleaning, analyzing and manipulating data.

import numpy as np:
- This python library is used for dealing with arrays.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt:
- Used to create visualizations in Python.

- Sklearn was used for the various machine learning libraries in order to train the model.

I trained using both the MLP and KNN model to see which will produce the most accurate results.
